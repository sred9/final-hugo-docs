# HTML Tutorial

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is the basic building block of World Wide Web.

Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references to other text that the user can immediately access, usually by a mouse click or key press.

```java
  System.out.println('Hello World!');
  ```


{{< codes java javascript >}}
  {{< code >}}
  ```java
  System.out.println('Hello World!');
  ```
  {{< /code >}}
  {{< code >}}
  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello World!');
  ```
  {{< /code >}}
{{< /codes >}}

## Formatting Text

HTML provides several tags that you can use to make some text on your web pages to appear differently than normal text, for example, you can use the tag `<b>` to make the text bold, tag `<i>` to make the text italic, tag `<mark>` to highlight the text, tag `<code>` to display a fragment of computer code, tags `<ins>` and `<del>` for marking editorial insertions and deletions, and more.

The following example demonstrates the most commonly used formatting tags in action. Now, let's try this out to understand how these tags basically work:

    <p>This is <b>bold text</b>.</p>
    <p>This is <strong>strongly important text</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is <i>italic text</i>.</p>
    <p>This is <em>emphasized text</em>.</p>
    <p>This is <mark>highlighted text</mark>.</p>
    <p>This is <code>computer code</code>.</p>
    <p>This is <small>smaller text</small>.</p>
    <p>This is <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> text.</p>
    <p>This is <del>deleted text</del>.</p>
    <p>This is <ins>inserted text</ins>.</p>

By default, the `<strong>` tag is typically rendered in the browser as `<b>`, whereas the `<em>` tag is rendered as `<i>`. However, there is a difference in the meaning of these tags.
